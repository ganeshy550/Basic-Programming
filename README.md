## ðŸ”° What is a Programming Language?

A programming language is a formal system used to write instructions that a computer can execute.  
These instructions, or code, enable programmers to communicate with computers and tell them what to do.  
Programming languages provide the **syntax** and **rules** for structuring these instructions, allowing developers to create software, applications, and systems.

### ðŸŒŸ Basic Overview:

- **Syntax:**  
  The set of rules that defines how to structure a program. Each programming language has its own syntax that must be followed.

- **Semantics:**  
  The meaning behind the syntax. It dictates how the instructions will be executed by the computer.

- **Variables and Data Types:**  
  Variables store data values, and data types define the kind of data that can be stored and manipulated.

- **Control Structures:**  
  These include conditional statements like `if`, `else`, `switch` and loops like `for`, `while`, which control the flow of execution in a program.

- **Functions/Methods:**  
  Reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks, making programs modular and organized.
